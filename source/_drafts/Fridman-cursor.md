[(00:15:53)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=oFfVt3S51T4&t=953) To highlight and summarize at a high level, I’d say that there are two things that Cursor is pretty good at right now. There are other things that it does, but two things that it helps programmers with. One is this idea of looking over your shoulder and being a really fast colleague who can kind of jump ahead of you and type and figure out what you’re going to do next. And that was the original idea behind… That was kind of the kernel of the idea behind a good auto complete was predicting what you’re going to do next, but you can make that concept even more ambitious by not just predicting the characters after your Cursor but actually predicting the next entire change you’re going to make, the next diff, next place you’re going to jump to.
(00:15:53) 高屋建瓴地总结一下，我认为 Cursor 目前做得比较好的有两点。它还有其他的功能，但主要帮助程序员解决的两个问题是：一是它能够像一位站在你肩旁的同事一样，快速地跳到前面，帮你输入和预测你接下来要做什么。这正是最初构思自动补全功能的核心理念……那就是预测你接下来要输入的字符，但我们可以将这个概念进一步拓展，不仅仅预测 Cursor 后面的字符，甚至预测你接下来将要进行的整个更改、下一个差异、下一个跳转位置。

And on both of those we’ve done a lot of work on making the editing experience for those things ergonomic and also making those things smart and fast.
(00:16:35) 第二件事是 Cursor 现在也做得很好，有时能帮助你跳过 AI，直接告诉它该做什么，从指令过渡到代码。在这两方面，我们都做了大量工作，使编辑体验更加人性化，同时让这些功能更加智能和快速。
